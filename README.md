Demand Forecasting Using Quantum Computing

Description:

This project implements demand forecasting using quantum computing–inspired models alongside classical machine learning techniques. The notebook demonstrates how quantum circuits and hybrid approaches can be applied to time-series forecasting problems. The goal is to analyze whether quantum models can capture complex demand patterns more effectively compared to traditional approaches.

Key Highlights:

Data preprocessing and normalization for demand forecasting

Classical ML baseline models for comparison

Quantum circuit–based forecasting approach

Performance evaluation and analysis of quantum vs classical models

Practical use case of quantum computing in business analytics
